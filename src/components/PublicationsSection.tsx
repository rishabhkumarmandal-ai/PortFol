      description: "The guarantee accurate control of crucial variables like temperature, humidity, pressure, and equipment efficiency, these systems make use of IoT devices, AI techniques, and big data analytics. Through sophisticated data perspectives, the cloud-based strategy enables predictive maintenance, improves flexibility, and lowers operating expenses. Stakeholders may make prompt, data-driven choices from anywhere with remote access to control rooms. These seminars provide practical experience with cloud-controlled settings and function as training and development centres. The system's flexibility to meet a range of industrial demands is further enhanced by its compatibility with external tools and equipment. ",

      description: " Using big data-driven approaches to optimize talent recruitment is essential for improved decisions in the cutthroat world of BI. The efficacy of many machine learning algorithms to increase recruiting performance and accuracy is compared in this investigation. For optimizing, cross-validating, and hyperparameter modification were employed. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm has the greatest accuracy (92.9%), trailed by the Gradient Boosting Classifying system ($mathbf{92.6 }$) and the neural network (NNs) models (${92}.7 $).",
